# Assignment: DOM Shuffling - 3/3/2021

Oh no! We've got a gremlin in our server that's moving elements all over the place. Thankfully, we've got an older version of the page as a reference to put things back in order. Whenever we upload it, though, the same shuffling occurs on our page. We have to write some code to find their resulting positions and move them to their correct places once the page has loaded.

You'll want to have both the original and mixed up pages open to make comparisons. Create a Javascript file and include it in the mixup HTML file before the closing `body` tag. Write any code you need to take the elements from where they currently are and move them to the right places. Refresh your page as you work on this. When an element is in the right spot, it will have a light green background; when it isn't, the background will be red.

You can grab the necessary files for this assignment [here](https://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/dom_shuffling/dom_shuffling_20200829_completed.zip). The `original.html` file is what you want to produce by manipulating the HTML in `mixup.html`. You should attempt to locate the misplaced elements and move them to where they belong. There are many ways to complete this problem, so there's no one right answer.
