A vacation is when you take a trip to some ADJECTIVE place
with your ADJECTIVE family. Usually you go to some place
that is near a/an NOUN or up on a/an NOUN.
A good vacation place is one where you can ride a NOUN
or play NOUN or go hunting for a NOUN. I like
to spend my time with a NOUN or a NOUN.
When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating a noun a day,
and fathers play golf, and mothers
sit around a NOUN. Last summer, my little brother
VERB in a/an NOUN and got poison NOUN all
over his NOUN. My family is going to go to (the)
NOUN, and I will practice to VERB. Parents
need vacations more than kids because parents are always very ADJECTIVE
and because they have to work ADJECTIVE
hours every day all year making enough of a NOUN to pay
for the vacation.
