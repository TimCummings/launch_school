## Day 2 - Corruption Checksum
### Part 2 - 12/8/2017

---
"Based on what we're seeing, it looks like all the User wanted is some information about the evenly divisible values in the spreadsheet. Unfortunately, none of us are equipped for that kind of calculation - most of us specialize in bitwise operations."

It sounds like the goal is to find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. They would like you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's result.

For example, given the following spreadsheet:
```
5 9 2 8
9 4 7 3
3 8 6 5
```
In the first row, the only two numbers that evenly divide are 8 and 2; the result of this division is 4.
In the second row, the two numbers are 9 and 3; the result is 3.
In the third row, the result is 2.
In this example, the sum of the results would be 4 + 3 + 2 = 9.

What is the sum of each row's result in your puzzle input?

### Solution

* Input: string representing a spreadsheet containing rows of numbers


* Output: integer representing input's `checksum`
  - `checksum`: sum of the difference between a row's largest and smallest values, for all rows


* Pseudocode:
  - split input string into array of rows
  - map array of rows to array of arrays of numbers (converting to integers)
  - map array of arrays of numbers to array of evenly divisible pairs
  - map array of pairs to array of quotients
  - reduce array of quotients by summing


* Solution: [day_02-2.rb](day_02-2.rb)
