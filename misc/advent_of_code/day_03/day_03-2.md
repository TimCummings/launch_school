## Day 3 - Spiral Memory
### Part 2 - 1/3/2017

---
As a stress test on the system, the programs here clear the grid and then store the value 1 in square 1. Then, in the same allocation order as shown above, they store the sum of the values in all adjacent squares, including diagonals.

So, the first few squares' values are chosen as follows:

* Square 1 starts with the value 1.
* Square 2 has only one adjacent filled square (with value 1), so it also stores 1.
* Square 3 has both of the above squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, 2.
* Square 4 has all three of the aforementioned squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, 4.
* Square 5 only has the first and fourth squares as neighbors, so it gets the value 5.
* Once a square is written, its value does not change. Therefore, the first few squares would receive the following values:

```
147  142  133  122   59
304    5    4    2   57
330   10    1    1   54
351   11   23   25   26
362  747  806--->   ...
```
What is the **first value written** that is **larger** than your puzzle input?

Your puzzle input is still `347991`.

### Solution

* Input: integer representing sequential square to be accessed in spiral memory


* Output: integer representing the shortest path (Manhattan Distance) from the input square to the origin (first/middle square of spiral memory)
  - Manhattan Distance: if treating spiral memory as a coordinate plane, this is the sum of the absolute values of `x` and `y` movements in the shortest path between two points


* Pseudocode:
  - represent spiral memory up to the requested square
    + data structure: hash
      * use sequence number as the key
      * use an array representing x and y coordinates as the value
    + initialize spiral memory with the first/origin square with coordinates [0, 0]
  - to obtain the spiral pattern, squares are allocated in increasingly growing lines following a specific, repeating directional pattern
    + the first line (excluding the origin square) is a single square in length
    + line size does not increase until two lines have been placed
    + the directional pattern is: right, up, left, down
      * line length increases by 1 on right and left directions
  - calculate the shortest path
    + shortest path is the sum of the absolute values of the requested square's x and y coordinates
