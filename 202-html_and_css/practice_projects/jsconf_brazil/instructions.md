# Practice Project 1: JSConf Brazil - 10/4/2020

For this project, your goal is to reproduce the following web page as closely as possible. Aim for pixel perfection, though you almost certainly will not match the project exactly - just get as close as you can:

[JSConf Brazil](http://2014.jsconfbr.org/)

This project is probably the most difficult one in this course; it's more difficult, in many ways, than the one we used to give during the assessment. There is no time limit, so take your time and do the best you can. Most students need several days to complete it.

When you work on this site:

* Skip any animation.
* Skip the Google Maps section.
* Make sure you implement links as links (you can use `"#"` as the `href`)
* Make sure you see an appropriate mouse pointer when you hover over linkable items.
* Make sure you implement the rollover effects in the Speakers section (feel free to use lorem ipsum text here).
* Make sure you duplicate the narrow strip of gray at the top of the page.
* Make sure you duplicate the fixed positioning of the navigation bar.
* Implement responsive features. Almost all sections of the page change at different widths. Don't forget to check them all. In particular, pay attention to the layout of photos in the Speakers section, and the format of the individual sessions in the Schedule section.
* Note that the Sponsors section is a bit tricky due to inconsistencies. Don't stress too much about the exact appearance of this section.
* Use semantic HTML wherever possible. In particular, take a closer look every time you're tempted to use a `<div>` or `<span>`.
* Try to avoid over-qualified selectors. For instance, do you need to say `main p em.green` when `.green` is all you need?
* Make sure your HTML markup passes the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
* Make sure your CSS passes the W3C [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).
* Consider using an HTML or CSS linter (see the [Install Software assignment](https://launchschool.com/lessons/4495fbf7/assignments/70abbf75)) to identify potentially troublesome HTML and CSS.
* Inspect your work with several browsers if you can, including mobile browsers.
* Use blink comparisons to identify discrepancies.

If you're stuck, feel free to check the actual HTML or CSS for implementation ideas.
