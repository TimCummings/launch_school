## Series

Write a program that will take a string of digits and give you all the possible consecutive number series of length n in that string.

For example, the string "01234" has the following 3-digit series:
```
- 012
- 123
- 234
```
And the following 4-digit series:
```
- 0123
- 1234
```
And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.

Test suite:
``` ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'
require_relative 'series'

class SeriesTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_simple_slices_of_one
    series = Series.new('01234')
    assert_equal [[0], [1], [2], [3], [4]], series.slices(1)
  end

  def test_simple_slices_of_one_again
    skip
    series = Series.new('92834')
    assert_equal [[9], [2], [8], [3], [4]], series.slices(1)
  end

  def test_simple_slices_of_two
    skip
    series = Series.new('01234')
    assert_equal [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], series.slices(2)
  end

  def test_other_slices_of_two
    skip
    series = Series.new('98273463')
    expected = [[9, 8], [8, 2], [2, 7], [7, 3], [3, 4], [4, 6], [6, 3]]
    assert_equal expected, series.slices(2)
  end

  def test_simple_slices_of_two_again
    skip
    series = Series.new('37103')
    assert_equal [[3, 7], [7, 1], [1, 0], [0, 3]], series.slices(2)
  end

  def test_simple_slices_of_three
    skip
    series = Series.new('01234')
    assert_equal [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]], series.slices(3)
  end

  def test_simple_slices_of_three_again
    skip
    series = Series.new('31001')
    assert_equal [[3, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]], series.slices(3)
  end

  def test_other_slices_of_three
    skip
    series = Series.new('982347')
    expected = [[9, 8, 2], [8, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 7]]
    assert_equal expected, series.slices(3)
  end

  def test_simple_slices_of_four
    skip
    series = Series.new('01234')
    assert_equal [[0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4]], series.slices(4)
  end

  def test_simple_slices_of_four_again
    skip
    series = Series.new('91274')
    assert_equal [[9, 1, 2, 7], [1, 2, 7, 4]], series.slices(4)
  end

  def test_simple_slices_of_five
    skip
    series = Series.new('01234')
    assert_equal [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]], series.slices(5)
  end

  def test_simple_slices_of_five_again
    skip
    series = Series.new('81228')
    assert_equal [[8, 1, 2, 2, 8]], series.slices(5)
  end

  def test_simple_slice_that_blows_up
    skip
    series = Series.new('01234')
    assert_raises ArgumentError do
      series.slices(6)
    end
  end

  def test_more_complicated_slice_that_blows_up
    skip
    slice_string = '01032987583'

    series = Series.new(slice_string)
    assert_raises ArgumentError do
      series.slices(slice_string.length + 1)
    end
  end
end
```

### Solution
* input: string
* output:
  - array of numbers
  - array of arrays of numbers
* edge cases:
  - substring size > string size; raise ArgumentError


* Pseudocode
  - note: problem description lends itself well to early transformation of number string to array of digits
    + followup: after implementing a first solution this way, arrays aren't quite as intuitive to work with as I had hoped; implementing a second solution working with strings
    + followup 2: There is little difference between the two solutions.
  - guard against edge case: raise ArgumentError unless substring size <= string size
  - starting at index 0, iterate through each digit while the index + substring size < string size
    + from the index to index + substring size, push each digit into an array
    + push this array into a results array
  - return the results array


* Solution: [series.rb](series.rb)
