## Day 5 - A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike
### Part 2 - 1/9/2018

Now, the jumps are even stranger: after each jump, if the offset was three or more, instead decrease it by `1`. Otherwise, increase it by `1` as before.

Using this rule with the above example, the process now takes `10` steps, and the offset values after finding the exit are left as `2 3 2 3 -1`.

How many steps does it now take to reach the exit?

### Solution

* Add `adjust_offset` method
  - if the current offset is greater than or equal to three, decrease it by 1
  - otherwise, increase it by 1

* Refactor `find_exit` method to use new `adjust_offset` method
  - adjust the value in the array at the current position according to the `adjust_offset` method
