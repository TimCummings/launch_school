# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.

# I currently like the Ruby on Rails API (http://api.rubyonrails.org) the best, because of its layout. I like the series of dropdown menus on the left side of the page that allow quick/easy navigation to other sections without having to user browser navigation or multiple windows/tabs to quickly access related information.
