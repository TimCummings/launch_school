# Walkthrough: Using a Photoshop Design File (PSD) - 10/1/2020

n this walkthrough, we'll demonstrate how to build a photography blog starting with a Photoshop file provided by our designer. If you have Photoshop, you can [download the design files here](https://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/lesson_2/photography_blog/site_design.psd).

Even if you don't have Photoshop or an acceptable alternative, you should watch this video. While using a PNG file is considerably different from using a PSD file, the general techniques of measuring components are still pertinent. If you don't have Photoshop but still want to work on this project, you can extract the image files you'll need from the [completed archive](https://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/202/projects/lesson_7/photo_blog_final.zip).

Our walkthrough starts with cutting the image assets from the Photoshop file, then creating the HTML and CSS for the header.
