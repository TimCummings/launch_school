# On Your Own: Floats and Positioning - 9/29/2020

We've put together a summary of CSS box models, floats and positioning rules with examples and made a page for it. [See it here](https://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/202/projects/lesson_6/box_model_v2/main.html).

Reproduce this page with HTML and CSS on your own. You can grab the raw text [here](https://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/202/projects/lesson_6/box_model_v2/main.txt).

This project may be challenging. If you get stuck, don't be afraid to look at the example HTML and [CSS](https://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/202/projects/lesson_6/box_model_v2/main.css).
