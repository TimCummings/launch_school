Create a page that displays a grid of animal images and shows a tooltip for each animal that contains more information about the animal.
Requirements

* Choose any animals that you want.
* Create markup that includes an image and caption for each animal.
* Hide the captions initially.
* Display the caption as a tooltip when the user hovers the mouse cursor over the image for more than two seconds. Close the tooltip when the user moves the mouse off the image.
* Don't display the caption tooltip when the user moves the cursor off the image before the two second time delay elapses.
