# OO Tic Tac Toe

### 1. Write a textual description of the problem or exercise.
Tic Tac Toe is a two player game where players, each identified with a specific mark, alternate picking available spots on a grid. The first player to get a full line on the grid wins. A full line is an unbroken sequence of spots, either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, taking up the grid's full length in that direction.

If all available spots on the grid are selected, but no player has a full line, then the game ends in a tie.

### 2. Extract the major nouns and verbs from the description.
* Nouns:
  - players
    + marks
  - grid
    + spots
    + lines
  - result


* Verbs:
  - pick (a spot)
  - get a full line
  - win/lose/tie

### 3. Organize and associate the verbs with the nouns.
* players
  - pick spots
  - get a full line
  - win/lose/tie


* grid


* result
