## Backup and Restore Atom configuration
You need only the `.json`, `.cson`, `.coffee` and `.less` files in the `~/.atom` folder, and a list of packages you had installed:

run from command line on old install
```shell
apm list --installed --bare > packages.list
```
then you do from the command line on your new install
```shell
apm install `cat packages.list`
```
(notice the backticks in that last command, not regular quotes)

This should work on Linux/Mac OSX, donâ€™t know about windows though

For the install, you can also just use:
```shell
apm install --packages-file packages.list
```
which should work on all supported Atom platforms.

* packages.list content as of 4/26/2018:
  - fonts@3.0.3
  - isotope-ui@2.8.5
  - oceanic-next@1.0.0
