# On Your Own: Company Site - 10/2/2020

To date, our projects have been simple, single-page projects, but most websites have multiple pages and different layouts throughout those pages. We're going to build a more realistic site by turning design files for the Space Designs company into a nearly complete HTML and CSS web site.

Space Design wants us to upgrade their site from the single page we built in the previous lesson to a multi-page site with pages for projects and the team in addition to the homepage. Each page will have the same markup for the header and footer, but it will highlight the selected page in the navigation bar.

Start by [downloading the design files](https://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/202/projects/lesson_7/spacedesign.zip); it contains the design files and the cutout images you'll need. You can obtain text copy from a site like [lipsum](http://lipsum.com).

> We've learned that GIMP does not handle the PSD design files for this project properly. There doesn't seem to be a good fix for this issue.

The design files use the `Avenir` font, a font not pre-installed on most systems. You can choose the font stack Avenir, Nunito, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. If you want, you can download Nunito for free.

Link the three pages together via the navigation links. Make sure you place a class on the nav item for the current page to make it visually distinct.)

## Header and Navigation

In this part of the project, construct the header and navigation part of the company site.
