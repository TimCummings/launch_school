// Student Grade
//
// Write a program to determine a studentâ€™s grade based on the average of three scores you get from the user. Use these rules to compute the grade:
//
//     If the average score is greater than or equal to 90 then the grade is 'A'
//     If the average score is greater than or equal to 70 and less than 90 then the grade is 'B'
//     If the average score is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 70 then the grade is 'C'
//     If the average score is less than 50 then the grade is 'F'
//
// You may assume that all input values are valid positive integers.
// Example
//
// // prompts to get the 3 scores
// Enter score 1: 90
// Enter score 2: 50
// Enter score 3: 78
//
// // log to the console
// Based on the average of your 3 scores your letter grade is "B".

  }

  let sum = numbers.reduce((sum, number) => sum += number);
