# JavaScript Versions - 10/14/2020

* JavaScript is officially called ECMAScript.
* As of March 2020, the current spec is ECMAScript 2019 (AKA ECMAScript version 10, AKA ES10.)
* ECMAScript 2015/ES6 was a HUGE improvement. As such, modern JavaScript is commonly referred to as **ES6+**.
* Browser support is usually good but can be an issue, especially with newer features.
  * Consult a [compatibility table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/).
  * Consider a tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpiling.
* There is still plenty of ES5 "in the wild", so you'll need to be familiar with it and the differences between ES6 for now.
