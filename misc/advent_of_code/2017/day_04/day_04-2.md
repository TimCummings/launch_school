## Day 4 - High Entropy Passphrases
### Part 2 - 1/7/2018

---
For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.

For example:

* `abcde fghij` is a valid passphrase.
* `abcde xyz ecdab` is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.
* `a ab abc abd abf abj` is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when forming another word.
* `iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo` is valid.
* `oiii ioii iioi iiio` is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.

Under this new system policy, how many passphrases are valid?

### Solution

Refactor the `valid_phrase?` method:
* Pseudocode:
  - determine if the line (passphrase) is valid
    + create a hash to store words as keys and number of occurrences as values
    + split the phrase on whitespace to separate words
    + if a word is valid (only lowercase letters), sort its letters and add the resulting string to the word hash/increment its value
    + return false if a word is invalid
    + if any value is greater than 1, return false
    + otherwise return true
