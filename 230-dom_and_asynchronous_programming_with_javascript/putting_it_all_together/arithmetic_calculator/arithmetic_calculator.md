# Assignment: Arithmetic Calculator - 3/25/2021

Let's build a simple arithmetic calculator. It will have two inputs for numbers, a selection list that controls which arithmetic operation the calculator performs, and a button that performs the calculation. It will display the result above the inputs. This assignment combines your ability to interact with the DOM with your understanding of event listeners.

Since this project isn't too concerned about the HTML and CSS components, you can use the starter code from [this archive](https://d3905n0khyu9wc.cloudfront.net/arithmetic_calculator/arithmetic_calculator_20200829.zip). You will need to edit the HTML to load your JavaScript code.

If you prefer, you can write your own HTML and CSS. Feel free to spend time making it look professional or just slap something together. The focus of this project is JavaScript, so everything else is optional.

You may use jQuery or any other library you want. However, you can easily build this project with vanilla JavaScript and the DOM API. Our version doesn't use any libraries.
