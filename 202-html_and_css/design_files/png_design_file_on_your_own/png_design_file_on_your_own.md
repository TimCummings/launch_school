# On Your Own: Using a PNG Design File - 10/1/2020

In this project, we'll repeat the project demonstrated in the previous lesson. However, this time we're going to use a PNG file. You can download the PNG design file and its associated images [here](https://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/202/projects/lesson_7/photo_blog_png.zip).

Recall that the font is the Roboto Condensed font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed). See the first video from the Photoshop demonstration for information on how to install this font (the font segment begins at 09:00 into the video).

Ideally, you'll end up with a project that looks identical to the one supplied in the PNG file. In practice, you can expect some minor differences. Your goal is to get as close to the PNG file as you can; don't give up too soon.

Begin the project as you would any other project. When you're ready to begin coding, use the PNG file to measure the different box sizes, margins, padding, etc., as well as the colors you will need (don't forget the font colors). Get as much of the project done as possible before turning to a blink comparison.

Once you've got most of the project done, use a blink comparison to patch up the most visible issues.

You can compare your results against [our solution from the Photoshop demonstration](https://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/202/projects/lesson_7/photo_blog_final/index.html). You may also request a Code Review. For the best results, ask some specific questions in your review; it will help us focus on the parts that matter to you.
